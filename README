# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to perform a simplified simulation
of high-energy particle storms. Read the handout.pdf and use the 
sequential code (`energy_storms_seq.c`) as reference to study how the code works.

You will implement parallel versions of the code by modifying the following files:
- `energy_storms_mpi_omp_core.c` : MPI+OpenMP version
- `energy_storms_cuda_core.cu`   : CUDA version

In the submission, you are not allowed to modify any other files except those two.

To see a description of the Makefile options execute:
$ make help 

Use the input files in the `test_files` directory for your first tests.
Students are encouraged to manually write or automatically generate
their own input files for more complete tests. See a description of
the input files format in the handout.
